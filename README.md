Title: Train Schedule

Created by: Ellen Buelow

Intented Use: This website is intended for personnel working at a train station to keep track of the flow and schedules of the different trains. Each time you want to add a new train, use the 'Add Train' form to add a new train. This will add your train to your database and give you: Name, Destination, Frequency, Next Arrival, and minutes away.

Future Work: Create a delete button to remove data you not longer want to store. Create an error button if train times overlapped.
